#SECTION 1 PRACTICE PROBLEMS
#This practice will review topics from section 1 including variable assignment,
#typecasting, and working with input from the user
#NOTE: if you get errors, try and debug by looking them up

#1. GENERATE USERNAME
#write some code that gets a user's first and last name, then prints a custom
#username made of the first letter of their first name and the first 4 letters
#of their last name -- for now assume the last name has at least 4 letters
#Example: "Jenny Walters" -> "jwalt"

#TIP: you can use .lower() to make a string all lowercase
#Example: name = "Brian" -> name = name.lower() -> name is now "brian"



#2. SUM NUMBERS
#write some code that gets three numbers from the user and returns the sum of
#those numbers



#3. PRINT DATE
#create three integer variables called day, month, and year and set them to the current date
#then print "Today's date is MM/DD/YYYY" where the Xs are replaced with the corresponding vars
#please use .format() for this example.
#NOTE: leading zeros are not allowed in Python (ex: 04), you can resolve this by using a string (ex: '04') then casting to int



#4. SWAP HALVES
#write some code that takes an 8 letter word from the user and prints the word
#with the first 4 letters and the last 4 letters swapped
#assume the user will enter a valid 8 letter word
#Example: word -> "buzzword", print "wordbuzz"
#some sample words to test - fuzzball, blizzard, buckjump, pickwick
